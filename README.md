LiveSplit ASL scripts for load removal and autosplitting for Dishonored 2.

## Usage

Open LiveSplit's splits editor and enter in the game's name. The autosplitter should appear above the splits. Simply click the Activate button.

If the plguin doesn't appear in LiveSplit automatically then you must download the script, add Control -> Scriptable Auto Splitter to your layout, open the layout settings, and point it to the file you downloaded. This is generally only used to test new scripts and normally shouldn't be used.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you're running the latest version of LiveSplit. Most autosplitters need at least version 1.6.
- Make sure you're comparing against game time: right click livesplit -> compare against -> game time
- Make sure the version of the game you're running is supported.
- Antivirus programs love to give false positives. Exclude the entire LiveSplit folder.
- Make sure there's only one process of your game open. Kill any extra ones that may be in the background with task manager.
- Try running livesplit as admin.
- If you've activated it through the splits editor make sure you don't have any Scriptable Auto Splitters added to your layout.
- Click settings beside deactivate and make sure it's pointing to the correct file. If you've downloaded someone else's splits this will likely be wrong.
- Make sure .NET 4.5 is installed: https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=30653
- If all else fails, reboot.

## Gamepass vs Windows Store
- if you are running the Windows store version of Dishonored 2, make sure to uncheck the "Gamepass support" checkmark in the options.
